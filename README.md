# D424 - Software Engineering Capstone

Hi! I'm Dylan Boyling and this is my Vacation Scheduling App which was created for the Software Engineering Capstone â€“ D424. 

The purpose of this mobile app is to provide users with a tool for managing and organizing their vacations and excursions. The app allows users to create, update, and delete vacation details such as the title, lodging, start date, and end date. It also facilitates the tracking of excursions associated with each vacation, including the title and date of the excursion. Features include detailed views, notifications for vacation and excursion dates, and sharing details of your vacation.

## How to use

The app starts with a welcome screen which contains a title, logo, and purple enter button. Tap the enter button to enter the app.

</p>
This screen contains the list of vacations you have created. To create a new vacation, tap the circular plus button in the bottom right corner of the screen. This will bring you to the vacation details page where you will need to enter the name of your vacation, lodging, start date, and end date. Heads up, the dates are validated so you need to make sure that your end date is after your start date. To finalize the creation of your vacation, tap the options menu in the top right corner (three vertical dots) and tap save.

Once the vacation has been saved, you will be returned back to your list of vacations. To add an excursion to your vacation, tap the vacation you wish to add an excursion to which will bring you to the vacation details screen.

</p>
Once in the vacation details screen, you will see all of the details about your information including any associated excursions. You can update your vacation details and save it the same way as when creating a vacation. To add an excursion to the vacation, tap the circular plus button in the bottom right corner of the screen. Enter the name of your excursion and the date that it occurs on. Heads up, the dates are validated so you need to make sure that your the date of the excursion occurs between the start and end dates of the vacation. When you are ready, tap the options menu in the top right corner (three vertical dots) and tap save.

Good job! You have now created a vacation and associated an excursion with it. After creating an excursion, you will return to the vacation details screen. From here, you can tap the options menu in the top right and either save any changes you've made, delete the vacation, set a reminder for the start and end date, or share the vacation and the details of any related excursions. 

Let's clean up! You cannot delete a vacation without first deleting any associated excursions, so tap the excursion you made earlier to enter the excursion details screen. Tap the top right options menu and you will see options to save any changes you've made, delete the excursion, or set a reminder for the day that the excursion occurs. Tap the delete option which will return us to the vacation details screen after deleting the excursion. Now that all of the excursions are deleted, we can delete the vacation itself. Tap the options menu in the top right corner and tap delete. 

Now that you've gone through the basics, you should have a good understanding of how to manage vacations and any associated excursions!
